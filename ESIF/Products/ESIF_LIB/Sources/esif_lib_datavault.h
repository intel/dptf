/*
 * Data Vault 2.0 Repository Overview:
 *
 * A "DataVault" is an Internal ESIF object that contains a Name and a Cache of
 * Key/Value Pairs, some of which may be persisted to disk after a restart, and
 * the contents of which may be populated from multiple sources, including Files,
 * GDDV BIOS object, Memory blocks (static and dynamic), Loadable Apps such as DPTF,
 * and ESIF shell commands. Keys flagged as "Persisted" in a DataVault cache are always
 * written to a file named "dvname.dv", where dvname is the name of the DataVault.
 *
 * A "DataRepo" or Repository is a Container (File, Memory, or GDDV object) that can
 * contain multiple Data Segments, each of which consists of a Header and a Payload.
 * The Header contains the DataVault name that the Segment is associated with, along
 * with other metadata, such as a Description, Payload Size, Class, and SHA256 Hash.
 * The Payload can contain different classes of data, such a list of Key/Value Pairs
 * [KEYS] or another Repo [REPO], and potentially other class types in the future.
 *
 * There are several types of Repo container formats that are supported:
 *
 *    1. Singleton Repo: Contains a single Header and Payload of Key/Value Pairs,
 *       Indicated by a Payload Class of KEYS.
 *
 *    2. Multi-Segment Repo: Contains two or more Header/Payload Data Segments
 *       concatenated together. Each Segment contains the DataVault name it will be
 *       loaded into, along with a Description, Size, Class, and SHA256 Hash.
 *
 *    3. Embedded Repo: Contains a Header/Payload where the Payload Class is REPO,
 *       which indicates that the Payload is another Repo (Singleton or Multi-Segment),
 *       and the SHA256 hash is for the entire Payload.
 *
 * Notes:
 *    A. DV 1.0 format Repos are supported for backwards compatibility (Read/Write)
 *       but may ONLY be Singleton Repos containing a Key/Value Pairs Payload.
 *    B. DV 2.0 Payloads may be compressed, but Headers are not compressed,
 *       unless they are part of the Payload in an Embedded Repo.
 *    C. Unlike DV 1.0, there is no longer a one-to-one relationship between
 *       a DataVault and its dvname.dv file, even for DV 1.0 Repos.
 *    D. The "Primary Repo" of a DataVault is the file stream that Persisted Keys
 *       are written to when they are added, deleted, or updated, 
 *       and is always named dvname.dv.
 *    E. Repos can use any file extension, but by convention we load the
 *       following types of files on startup:
 *         .dv  files are Singleton Repos and usually a DataVault's Primary Repo
 *         .dvx files are Singleton, Multi-Segment, or Embedded Repos.
 *       Repos with other extensions may be loaded manually in the ESIF shell.
 *    F. Primary Repos (dvname.dv) are Singleton Repos loaded in COPY mode,
 *       which means the Keys are loaded into the DataVault as Persisted values
 *       and will replace any keys that may already exist in the DataVault Cache.
 *    G. Multi-Segment or Embedded Repos (name.dvx or GDDV) are loaded in MERGE mode,
 *       which means the Keys are loaded as NON-Persisted values and will NOT
 *       replace any keys that already exist in the DataVault Cache.
 *    H. Multiple Singleton and Multi-Segment Repos may be combined together
 *       merely by concatenating their .dv and .dvx files together.
 *    I. On startup, all Repos are loaded alphabetically (All .dv files then .dvx files)
 *       but the data in a Primary Repo effectively takes precedence over all other
 *       Repos, including the optional GDDV object in BIOS.
 *    J. Any type of Repo may be loaded into the optional GDDV object in BIOS,
 *       but for DV 2.0, it will usually be an Embedded Repo so that any Data Segment(s)
 *       contained in the Repo can be compressed and the SHA256 hash will be computed
 *       for all segment(s) in the Payload.
