// The main unit of work done by policy engines. This is the piece of data that
// DPTF Framework creates and exposes to the Policy Engines. Internally, the
// framework may have more data stored for the work items. An example internal data
// could be policy context that identifies who created a PolicyEventPolicy type of
// work item.
//
// All entries within the POLICY_WORKITEM structure are considered read only to the
// policy engine. Policy Engine can set the member values when it creates the work
// item using ::CreateWorkItem interface function. Policy Engine can
// read the member values inside the Execute implementation when the work item is
// dispatched for execution by the policy.
