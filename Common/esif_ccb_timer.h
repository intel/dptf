/*
 * INTERFACE - The interface consists of the following:
 *
 *    esif_ccb_timer_t - Opaque timer type
 *
 *    esif_ccb_timer_init - Initializes esif_ccb_timer_t objects, must be
 *        called befor use of the objec in other interface functions
 *
 *    esif_ccb_timer_kill- Destroys a timer object. After being killed, a timer
 *        object should not be used again without first calling esif_ccb_timer
 *        init. Note:  Returns after marking the timer for delete, but full
 *        destruction may not occur until after returning.  If synchronous
 *        destruction is required, use esif_ccb_timer_kill_w_wait.
 *
 *    esif_ccb_timer_kill_w_wait- Kills a timer object and does not return until
 *        the callback is complete or timer is cancelled.  (For Windows kernel,
 *        it is not recommended to kill the timer in the callback function
 *        frequently due to repeated calls to flush the DPC queue.)
 *
 *    esif_ccb_timer_set_msec - Sets the timeout and starts the timer
 *
 *    esif_ccb_timer_cb - Timer callback typedef
 *
 *    esif_ccb_tmrm_init - May optionally be called before any timer is
 *        initialized (The code will self-initialize if not called, but calling
 *        this will prevent issues if more than one thread may attempt to create
 *        the first timer at the same time.)
 *
 *    esif_ccb_tmrm_exit - Should be called to cleanup the timer manager after
 *        all timers are destroyed and no other timers will be created.
 *        This functions is expected to be called when the system is in a
 *        "known" state where not attempts to create any timers are in flight
 *        as this function destroys the lock controlling synchronization
 *
 * IMPORTANT!!!!
 *
 *     In order to use this code, the "C" implementation code may be included in one
 *     of two ways:  Include the "C" implementation file, esif_ccb_timer.c, in the
 *     compilation, or include only this header file and declare the #define
 *     ESIF_CCB_TIMER_MAIN  before inclusion of all other CCB header files in
 *     ONE AND ONLY ONE file of an execution unit.
 *
 *     In addition, this code requires the inclusion of the CCB linked list
 *     implementation by similar methods.  See esif_link_list.h.
